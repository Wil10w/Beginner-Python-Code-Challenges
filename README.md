# Beginner-Python-Code-Challenges
I am a self-taught beginner Python programmer. 
All the beginner programs in this repository were learnt and completed through the intro to Python certificates on edX.org. 
I highly recommend the course to anyone starting out. 
I have completed cer II and can confidently say that I have sucessfully completed 40+ beginner Python programming challenges - through the course and on CodeWars website. 

Day one, I was unable to even remember the 'print' statement - now, at the completion of cer II, I feel confident enough to write fuctions without refering to any documentation.

This these .py files will show anyone browsing - that Python can be learnt by anyone willing to ignore the fear of failure and dedicate a few hours a day to the edX Python course.
